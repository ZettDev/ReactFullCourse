Props = read-only properties that are shared between components. A parent component can send data to a child component.
Ex.: <Component key= value/>

Prop types = a mechanism that ensures the passed value is of the correct datatype. If the value is not of the correct
datatype, a warning will be shown in the console. This will be used mostly for debugging purposes, and it is a good
practice.
Ex.: age: PropTypes.number

Default props = default values for props. If the prop is not passed from the parent component,
the default value will be used.
Ex.: age: 0
