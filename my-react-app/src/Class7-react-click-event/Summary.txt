Click event = an interaction made when a user clicks on a specific element. The interaction is responded
by sending a callback to the onClick event handler.
Ex.:
function handleClick() {
  console.log('I was clicked');
}

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
This will log 'I was clicked' to the console when the button is clicked.

event argument: with click events we are automatically provided with an event argument, it is an object
that describes the event that occurred. When used as a parameter in a function, it is often referred to as "e".

To use it, we can pass it as a parameter to the function that calls the callback function.
Ex.: <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>

Also, it allows us to access and alter the event object and its properties.
Ex.: function handleClick(e) {
  e.target.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
}
This will change the background color of the element that was clicked to blue.
