React hook:  a special function that allows you to use React features, without needing to write a class.

An example of a React hook is the useState() hook.

useState() hook: a react hook that allows the creation of state variables, those variables, when updated,
will cause it to change in the Virtual DOM, this means that it will re-render the component, unlike
regular variables.
ex.: const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
The the "count" is the state variable itself, the "0" represents the initial value of the state variable,
and the "setCount" is the function that will be used to update the state variable.

To update the state variable, use the setCount function: setCount(count);
Trying to update the state variable directly will not work, because it will not trigger a re-render of the
Virtual DOM.
